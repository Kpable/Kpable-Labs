# Kpable Labs

My develpment playground

I have an insatiable curiousity and too often fall into the rabbit hole of game dev articles and tutorials. As such, i've restructured this repo to support that with various branches. 

## The Game 

Since before i started my game dev education I always had to idea of creating a multiverse where i can play with various game elements in small isolated areas i'd call rooms. 

Now i look to make that a reality with this project. 

I plan to utilize git flow with the main Kpable Labs game, maintaining master, develop, and feature branches. Kpable Labs will be a sandbox game akin to terraria and starbound, not only because i really enjoy those games, but because i feel a sand box would give me the oppportunity to practice implmenting some elements and mechanics i'm interested in investigating. With my curiousity thats a whole lot i want to try. 

## The Other Stuff

There will come time inevitably where i will want to go through a tutorial or try out something really quick in which i wont want to start a whole new project and continue to add one shot projects to my development folder. 

As such i plan to keep tutorials and misc implmentations off on seperate branches that will never return to the main develop or master. It gives me a basis to work off of without searching a bunch of folders for a class i liked in this other project. 

I plan to keep a tutorials/develop and misc/develop that the one shots can branch off of and merge back to.
